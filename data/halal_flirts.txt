I didn’t trip over my thobe, I fell for you.
I've had to fast every day since the first time I saw you.

I must have died a shaheed and gone to heaven because you are my 72 virgins all in one.
I love the way your Abaya flows when you walk.
Your feet made me lower my gaze.
After seeing you, the first thing I said was Mash'Allah. The next was Inshallah!

It must be Laylatul Qadr, because that's the night that angels come down from Heaven.
You can be the queeen of my Hurs anyday.
You remind me of the Ka'aba. I can walk around you all day long.
Are your feet tired? Because you've been performing Tawaaf in my mind all day long?
Do you wanna date? I bought a box full when I went to Madinah.
