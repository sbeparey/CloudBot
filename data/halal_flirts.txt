I need to break my fast. Can I have a date?
I'd like to be more than just your brother in Islam.
What school of thought do you follow, because I thought about you all through school. 
To watch you pray is a sin of its own. 
Do you believe in the hereafter? Oh, you do? Then you know what I'm hereafter.
Wow, you're beautiful! I see praying five times a day has paid off.
That hijab really compliments your eyes.
That's a nice burka. Can I talk you out of it?
I must have died a shaheed and gone to heaven because you like al-Hur al-'Een.
I love the way your abaya flows when you walk.
Your feet made me lower my gaze.
After seeing you, the first thing I said was mash'Allah. The next was insh'Allah!
Would you like to share my prayer-mat?
It must be Laylatul Qadr, because that's the night that angels come down from Heaven.
You remind me of the Ka'aba. Black abaya and love-inspiring
Do you wanna date? I bought a box full when I went to Madinah.
Muslims are supposed to have many children, and I am willing to do my part...
Allah created everyone in pairs, so what are you doing, single?
Would you like me to help you wake up for fajr?
Can I have your guardian's phone number? 
Is your hijab naturally blonde?
Have your mom call my mom. 
You're the garlic sauce to my shawarma.
You are masha'Allah perfect.
